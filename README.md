# Digit classification model
This project aims to create a model that recognizes handwritten digits using a dataset from Kaggle.
The model accurately classifies images of numbers ranging from 0 to 9.

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to train on the MNIST dataset and develop a model for digit recognition. The main steps include data preparation, model construction, training, evaluation, and testing.
